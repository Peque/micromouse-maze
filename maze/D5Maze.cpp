/*
      when each cell is added to the queue, we should store the direction
      to the cell we came from.
      when flooding using directions, I need to take into account my currnt
      heading so that I don't have to stop to turn around unless absolutely necessary.
      On the other hand, suppose the route found that way is much longer?
      This should not matter when exploring and should not happen when fast running?
      Ideally, the solver will produce a vector field telling me which way to LEAVE
      each cell to get to my goal.
      Generally, flooding out from the goal allows me to walk downhill but the
      starting direction is arbitrary.
      Flooding out from the start should let me get started sooner but my
      algorithm will have to be able to backtrack to makesure I have the best route.
      This starts to make it look more like an A* algorithm.
      Perhaps this is fine if I only need to go back one step. The queue based flooder
      here can store a direction in each cell that tells me how to find its predecessor
      then I can update the predecesor with a different cost and direction if necessary.
      Looks like it would be best if the flags, direction and distance for each cell
      was stored in a structure for neatness.
