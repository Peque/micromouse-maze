 * This module concerns itself only with the direct manipulation of the maze
 * data structures:
 *  - setting and clearing walls
 *  - testing walls
 *  - setting and getting costs
 *  - setting and getting directions
 *  - providing utilities like finding a neighbour location
 *
 * There should be no global variables in here,
 * only functions, types and constants
 * instance variables will be declared static in maze.c allowing implemenation
 * to be changed without affecting API
